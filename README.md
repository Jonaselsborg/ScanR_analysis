# ScanR_analysis
ScanR and BiFC analysis (thesis)

Here are all the files needed to produced the plots found in the thesis. 
Data is included as text files. 

You can try to run the R script yourself if you are interested - the script has been commented to explain what it does.
Line 11 of the script has been commented, as I run the script from my dropbox. Your working directory may be different, so this should be set accordingly.
